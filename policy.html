                <p class="italic mb-4">
                    U.S. healthcare is exceptionally expensive not because of higher quality but due to market design: patients are insulated from prices by insurers, which cripples competition and accountability. Nearly 18% of GDP goes to health care, yet large inefficiencies persist. For example, a recent analysis found U.S. hospital administrative expenses ($687B in 2023) are roughly double what hospitals spend on direct patient care, while international comparison shows the U.S. spends five times more per capita on administration than other wealthy nations.
                </p>
                <p class="italic mb-4">
                    Hidden, negotiated pricing causes extreme variation - e.g. the same coronary bypass surgery has been negotiated for as little as ~$28K or as much as $248K in the same region. Vertical integration (hospitals buying physician practices) has also sharply raised prices (15% higher for physicians' services post-merger) with no evidence of better quality.
                </p>
                <p class="italic mb-4">
                    Key takeaways: Independent research (RAND, MedPAC, CBO, Bipartisan Policy Center) warns that these distortions waste hundreds of billions. By contrast, consumer-driven approaches that restore "skin in the game" funded health accounts, high-deductible insurance, transparent prices, and competitive primary care can lower costs and improve value.
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                    In line with this, Congress and regulators should enable catastrophic/bronze plans paired with Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), mandate site-neutral payments to eliminate payor-arbitrage, and promote alternative care models like direct primary care. CBO estimates such site-neutral reforms alone could save over $157 billion in Medicare over 10 years. This paper outlines the problem and a concrete reform roadmap, arguing that U.S. healthcare is a market design problem - one that can be solved by "restoring the buyer" and empowering patients as economic actors.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">I. Introduction: The Economic Void at the Heart of American Healthcare</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The United States healthcare system, currently accounting for nearly 18% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), operates in a state of profound economic dissonance. It is a sector defined by advanced technological capability and clinical excellence, yet it is simultaneously crippled by a pricing mechanism that defies the fundamental laws of supply and demand.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The central thesis of this report validates the premise that the root cause of this dysfunction is not merely the volume of funds flowing into the system, but the structural "insulation" of the consumer from the economic transaction. This separation—whereby the patient consumes care but a third party (an insurer or the government) adjudicates payment—has created a "Buyer's Void." In this void, price signals are obscured, competition is stifled by consolidation, and administrative friction consumes a disproportionate share of resources that should be dedicated to clinical outcomes.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    This report offers a rigorous examination of the "Consumer-Anchored" model as a corrective framework. Grounded in empirical data from 2024 and 2025, peer-reviewed economic literature, and granular case studies of market-based reforms, we analyze the viability of shifting from a third-party payer architecture to one where the patient functions as a true economic agent—empowered by capital, information, and market discipline. The analysis confirms that while the transition is fraught with complexity, particularly regarding chronic disease management and equity, the prevailing "negative-sum game" of the status quo is unsustainable. With administrative costs now exceeding direct patient care expenditures by a ratio of nearly 2:1 in some hospital settings, the urgency for structural redesign has never been greater.<a href="#ref-3" class="citation">[3]</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We dissect the failures of previous consumer-driven attempts—specifically the blunt instrument of High-Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs)—and propose a "Next-Generation" model. This evolved framework integrates the liquidity of funded Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), the price discipline of Reference-Based Pricing (RBP), and the clinical intimacy of Direct Primary Care (DPC), underpinned by "Dynamic Safety Net" mechanisms inspired by international best practices and supply chain logic. By restoring the buyer, we argue, the system can pivot from value-blind inflation to value-based competition.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">II. The Structural Pathology of the Third-Party Payer System</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">
                    To understand the necessity of a consumer-anchored model, one must first diagnose the specific economic pathologies engendered by the third-party payer dominance. The current system is not a market in the traditional sense; it is a complex bureaucratic apparatus where revenue is derived from maximizing reimbursement codes rather than maximizing value for the patient. This structural flaw manifests in three critical domains: administrative waste, price distortion, and provider consolidation.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Administrative Wedge: The High Cost of Intermediation</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    A defining characteristic of the U.S. healthcare system is the immense volume of resources diverted from clinical care to administrative processing. The current model forces providers to function as data-entry clerks, coding specialists, and financial clearinghouses rather than solely as healers. This is not a peripheral inefficiency; it is the central economic reality of American medical practice.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Recent analyses of hospital expenditures have quantified this burden with alarming clarity. Data from 2025 reveals that administrative costs as a share of total hospital operating expenditures have continued to climb, now accounting for roughly 66.5% of spending, compared to just 33.5% for direct patient care.<a href="#ref-3" class="citation">[3]</a> This startling 2:1 ratio suggests that for every dollar allocated to the actual treatment of a patient—nursing, physician time, medication, and technology—two dollars are consumed by the machinery of compliance, billing, coding, and insurance negotiation.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    This creates a massive "administrative wedge" that drives a wedge between the cost of producing care and the price paid for it. Research indicates that U.S. healthcare administrative spending totals approximately $1 trillion annually, with the "financial transactions ecosystem"—the cost of processing claims and payments—accounting for $200 billion alone. The friction of processing a single claim can range from $12 to $19, and complex claims involving prior authorization can cost up to $50 to adjudicate.<a href="#ref-4" class="citation">[4]</a>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The implications of this administrative wedge are profound and regressive. It acts as a tax on the system, eroding the purchasing power of premiums and tax dollars. In international comparisons, the U.S. spends five times more per capita on administrative costs than other wealthy nations. This disparity is not driven by superior management or better data but by the fragmented nature of payment, where every transaction is a contested negotiation between a provider seeking revenue maximization and an insurer seeking medical loss ratio containment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "Restoring the Buyer" framework posits that a significant portion of this waste is intrinsic to the insurance model itself. When a patient pays a provider directly—as seen in the Direct Primary Care (DPC) model—the transaction cost drops to near zero. There are no claims to file, no denials to appeal, and no prior authorizations to adjudicate. The physician's time is reclaimed for patient care. By keeping the vast majority of routine transactions (primary care, labs, imaging) outside the insurance system, a consumer-anchored model attacks the root cause of this administrative bloat, potentially liberating hundreds of billions of dollars annually for actual service delivery.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Distortion of Price Formation and the "List Price" Fiction</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    In a functional market, prices emerge from the interplay of supply and demand, signaling value and scarcity. In the U.S. healthcare market, prices are administratively constructed or negotiated in secret, bearing little relation to cost, quality, or consumer preference. This opacity creates an environment where extreme price variation is the norm, not the exception.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Data from 2025 highlights the absurdity of current pricing structures. The negotiated rate for a coronary bypass can range from $27,683 to $247,902, an absolute difference of over $220,000 for the same procedure code, often within the same geographic region.<a href="#ref-6" class="citation">[6]</a> Similarly, diagnostic imaging presents a stark arbitrage opportunity that remains invisible to the insulated consumer. An echocardiogram performed in a hospital setting may command a price of $4,000 to $5,000, while the same clinical output from an independent imaging center costs $300 to $500.<a href="#ref-2" class="citation">[2]</a>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    These disparities are not driven by clinical acuity or outcomes but by "site-of-service" payment differentials. Medicare and private insurers have historically reimbursed hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) at significantly higher rates than independent physician offices for identical services. For instance, a chest X-ray may garner reimbursement 300% higher in a hospital than in a clinic. This policy failure creates a perverse incentive for consolidation: hospitals can acquire independent practices, rebrand them as outpatient departments, and immediately bill at the higher facility rate without changing the clinical service or location—a practice that arguably adds zero value while significantly increasing costs.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The consumer, shielded by copayments and deductibles that bear no relationship to the total cost, has no incentive (and often no ability) to discern these price differences. A patient paying a fixed $50 copay is indifferent to whether the underlying cost is $300 or $5,000. This indifference destroys the demand-side pressure that constrains prices in other sectors. Consequently, providers compete on prestige, technology arms races, and negotiating leverage with insurers, rather than on value to the patient.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Consolidation Crisis: Monopolies and Rising Prices</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The incentives created by opaque pricing and site-specific payment disparities have fueled a wave of vertical and horizontal consolidation that has fundamentally reshaped the U.S. healthcare landscape. Between 2012 and 2024, the percentage of physicians employed by or affiliated with hospital systems rose from under 30% to at least 47%.<a href="#ref-9" class="citation">[9]</a> This shift from independent practice to hospital employment is not merely a change in organizational chart; it is a driver of systemic inflation.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Empirical research from Yale University and other institutions demonstrates that when hospitals acquire physician practices, prices for services rise by an average of 14.1%.<a href="#ref-10" class="citation">[10]</a> These price hikes are attributed to increased market power and the exploitation of facility fees, rather than any measurable improvement in quality of care. In fact, studies analyzing childbirths—a common and standardized hospital event—found that two years after a hospital acquired an OB-GYN practice, prices for labor and delivery rose significantly, with physician prices jumping 15.1%.<a href="#ref-10" class="citation">[10]</a>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Consolidation also weakens the "countervailing power" of insurers. In highly concentrated provider markets, even large insurers struggle to negotiate favorable rates, as they cannot credibly threaten to exclude a dominant hospital system from their network without losing marketability to employers. This results in a "negative-sum game" where insurers pass higher costs onto employers and employees in the form of rising premiums and deductibles, while providers use their leverage to secure rate increases that outpace inflation.<a href="#ref-11" class="citation">[11]</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The economic consequences of this trend ripple beyond the healthcare sector. Rising healthcare prices act as a de facto payroll tax on the broader economy. Yale researchers estimate that a 1% increase in healthcare prices lowers payroll and employment at firms outside the health sector by approximately 0.4%.<a href="#ref-11" class="citation">[11]</a> This "spillover effect" depresses wages, reduces job growth, and strains the budgets of households and businesses alike. A consumer-anchored model, by exposing price variation and empowering patients to choose lower-cost independent providers, offers a mechanism to break this cycle of consolidation and restore competitive discipline.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">III. The Failed Experiment? Re-evaluating High Deductibles and the "Behavioral Hazard"</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The concept of "consumerism" in healthcare is not new. For the past two decades, the primary vehicle for introducing market forces has been the High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). The theory was simple: give consumers "skin in the game" via a high deductible (often $3,000 or more per family), and they will become rational shoppers, reducing unnecessary utilization and driving prices down. By 2025, approximately 33% of covered workers were enrolled in an HDHP with a savings option.<a href="#ref-12" class="citation">[12]</a>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    However, a candid assessment of the HDHP experiment reveals a mixed legacy that must be understood to design a better system. The "first-generation" consumer model failed to account for the complexity of medical decision-making and the financial fragility of low-income populations.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Blunt Instrument Problem: Delayed Care and Adverse Outcomes</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The evidence is overwhelming that HDHPs are effective at reducing healthcare spending. However, they often do so through a blunt mechanism: consumers reduce utilization of both low-value and high-value care.<a href="#ref-13" class="citation">[13]</a> Faced with the prospect of paying the full cost of a visit or prescription, many patients—lacking the clinical expertise to triage their own symptoms—simply avoided care altogether.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    A longitudinal cohort study of 343,137 adults with chronic illness found that HDHP enrollment was associated with statistically significant reductions in the use of evidence-based care, including guideline-concordant clinic visits and prescription drugs.<a href="#ref-15" class="citation">[15]</a> For example, patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease in HDHPs were found to delay filling prescriptions or skip doses to save money. This phenomenon is known as "behavioral hazard." Unlike "moral hazard" (where insurance encourages wasteful consumption), behavioral hazard occurs when patients under-consume necessary care because the immediate out-of-pocket cost looms larger than the long-term health benefit.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The consequences of this avoidance are severe. Research indicates that approximately 36% of U.S. adults reported skipping or postponing needed medical care due to cost in the past year.<a href="#ref-17" class="citation">[17]</a> For low-income populations, the deductible acts not as an incentive for efficiency, but as an insurmountable barrier to access. A 2025 study found that Medicare beneficiaries with "near-low" income (100-150% of the Federal Poverty Level) faced the highest rates of affordability challenges because they earned too much for full Medicaid subsidies but too little to absorb the cost-sharing of modern plans.<a href="#ref-18" class="citation">[18]</a>
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Limits of "Shoppability" in the Current Environment</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The "consumer" model relies on the assumption that healthcare services are "shoppable"—that patients can compare prices and quality before making a decision. While this holds true for elective procedures and routine diagnostics, it fails in the context of emergency care and complex chronic management.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Emergency care, by definition, precludes comparison shopping. A patient suffering a heart attack or a trauma does not check prices on an app; they go to the nearest hospital. Studies of hospital pricing for emergency services show that self-pay prices (relevant to the uninsured or those in the deductible phase) rose significantly between 2021 and 2023, with patients having zero leverage to negotiate.<a href="#ref-19" class="citation">[19]</a>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Even for shoppable services, the current transparency landscape is inadequate. Although federal rules now require hospitals and insurers to post prices, the data is often buried in massive, complex machine-readable files that are inaccessible to the average patient. While third-party aggregators like Turquoise Health are beginning to make this data usable, showing early signs of price convergence in competitive markets <a href="#ref-21" class="citation">[21]</a>, the cognitive load of navigating this system remains high. A 2025 analysis suggests that transparency is a necessary foundation but is insufficient on its own to drive broad market correction without accompanying financial incentives and simplified plan designs.<a href="#ref-22" class="citation">[22]</a>
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">Correcting the Failure: Value-Based Insurance Design (VBID)</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The failure of "first-generation" HDHPs does not invalidate the consumer model; rather, it necessitates a refinement. The "Next-Generation" model must incorporate Value-Based Insurance Design (VBID), which tailors cost-sharing based on clinical value. "Smarter" deductibles would exempt high-value services—such as insulin for diabetics, statins for heart patients, or primary care visits—from the deductible entirely.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Evidence shows that when employers adopt "Preventive Drug Lists" (PDLs) that exempt chronic medications from the deductible, medication adherence improves, and downstream costs (like emergency room visits) decrease.<a href="#ref-23" class="citation">[23]</a> The IRS has already expanded the list of preventive services that can be covered pre-deductible in HSA-qualified plans, recognizing that subjecting chronic disease management to a high deductible is "penny wise and pound foolish".<a href="#ref-25" class="citation">[25]</a> A fully realized consumer model would mandate that all evidence-based maintenance care for chronic conditions be exempt from the deductible, funded either by the insurer or through a dedicated "Chronic Care Account" separate from the catastrophic threshold. This resolves the behavioral hazard problem while maintaining price sensitivity for discretionary or shoppable services.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    The central pillar of the proposed reform is the shift from "defined benefit" insurance to "defined contribution" asset building. For a consumer market to function, the consumer must have capital. Currently, public subsidies (like ACA tax credits) and private subsidies (employer contributions) flow directly to insurance carriers. The patient never touches this money; they only experience the coverage it buys.

                    The "Funded Health Savings Account (HSA)" concept fundamentally restructures this flow. Instead of paying premiums to insurers to cover "first-dollar" risk, funds are deposited directly into patient-owned accounts. This liquidity empowers the patient to act as a buyer.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    The "HSA Option" proposed by the Paragon Health Institute provides a concrete policy mechanism for this shift. The proposal suggests allowing low-income exchange enrollees (those between 100% and 250% of the Federal Poverty Level) to choose a deposit into an HSA instead of the traditional Cost-Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidy that lowers deductibles.<a href="#ref-27" class="citation">[27]</a>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Currently, CSRs are paid to insurers to artificially lower the deductible of a silver plan. The patient may not even realize the subsidy exists. Under the HSA Option, the value of that subsidy—estimated at $1,500 to $2,000 annually for many enrollees—would be deposited directly into the patient's HSA.<a href="#ref-27" class="citation">[27]</a> This transforms the subsidy from a passive benefit into an active asset.

                    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Unlike insurance benefits, which are restricted to covered services and networks, HSA funds can be used for a broader array of health needs, including dental, vision, and over-the-counter medications.<a href="#ref-27" class="citation">[27]</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Accumulation:</strong> Insurance benefits are "use it or lose it"—they expire at the end of the plan year. HSA funds roll over indefinitely. This introduces a powerful accumulation dynamic: healthy behaviors and prudent shopping in one year build a capital reserve for future years. This aligns the patient's long-term financial interest with their health interest.<a href="#ref-27" class="citation">[27]</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Portability:</strong> The asset belongs to the individual, not the job or the insurer. This decouples health security from employment status, reducing "job lock" and providing stability during labor market transitions.</li>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    For the employer market, the "Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement" (ICHRA) serves as the vehicle for this transformation. ICHRAs allow employers to contribute tax-free dollars that employees use to buy their own individual market coverage, rather than enrolling in a group plan selected by the employer.<a href="#ref-28" class="citation">[28]</a>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    This model is gaining rapid traction. By 2025, ICHRA adoption among large employers grew by 34%, signaling that the market is ready for a defined-contribution approach.<a href="#ref-29" class="citation">[29]</a> Case studies illustrate the potential: New England Life Care, a company with 500 employees, transitioned to an ICHRA and reduced healthcare costs by 40%, redirecting $3.8 million to wage optimization.<a href="#ref-31" class="citation">[31]</a> The Rose Group, a hospitality company, saved $1.6 million and reduced employee turnover from 20% to 9% by offering ICHRAs, which allowed employees to choose plans that fit their specific needs rather than a "one-size-fits-all" group policy.<a href="#ref-31" class="citation">[31]</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    By moving employees into the individual market, ICHRAs create a massive, diversified risk pool that is not tied to any single employer. This stabilizes premiums and encourages insurers to compete for individual customers on price and quality, rather than competing for employer contracts based on network discounts.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    If the HSA provides the capital, Direct Primary Care (DPC) provides the venue for a functional market. DPC represents the most successful example of "de-financializing" routine healthcare. In this model, patients or employers pay a flat monthly membership fee directly to a physician practice for comprehensive primary care, bypassing insurance entirely for routine services.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Economics of DPC</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    DPC fundamentally alters the cost structure of primary care. By eliminating the insurance intermediary, DPC practices eliminate the "data entry clerk" burden. DPC physicians typically spend 40% to 60% less on overhead than traditional fee-for-service practices.<a href="#ref-32" class="citation">[32]</a> This efficiency allows them to reduce patient panel sizes from 2,500 to 600, enabling longer visits (30-60 minutes vs. 15 minutes), same-day access, and direct communication via text or email.<a href="#ref-33" class="citation">[33]</a>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The scalability of DPC is evidenced by its rapid growth. By 2025, employer adoption of DPC had surged, with 58% of all DPC memberships now sponsored by employers.<a href="#ref-30" class="citation">[30]</a> This shift is driven by the realization that investing in robust, accessible primary care reduces expensive downstream utilization.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">Case Studies in Success</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Union County, North Carolina:</strong> Facing rising costs, Union County offered a DPC option to its employees. In the first year, the county saved over $1.28 million. DPC participants incurred 23% lower medical expenses and 36% lower prescription costs compared to their peers in traditional plans.<a href="#ref-34" class="citation">[34]</a> The county achieved these savings while improving health outcomes, as 90% of DPC members with chronic conditions remained heavily engaged with their care.<a href="#ref-34" class="citation">[34]</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Rosen Hotels & Resorts:</strong> Operating in Orlando, Florida, Rosen Hotels created a self-funded healthcare model centered on an onsite medical facility that functions like a large-scale DPC. The program emphasizes access, with low or zero copays for primary care and drugs. The result: Rosen Hotels spends approximately 50% less per capita on healthcare than the average employer, saving an estimated $400 million over the life of the program.<a href="#ref-35" class="citation">[35]</a> This capital savings has been reinvested into employee scholarships and community development, demonstrating the broader economic potential of healthcare efficiency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>State of Nebraska Pilot:</strong> A pilot program for state employees demonstrated the viability of DPC even within a bureaucratic government framework. While initially small, the pilot showed high satisfaction and provided a template for integrating DPC into state benefit plans without legislative overhaul.<a href="#ref-36" class="citation">[36]</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These examples confirm that when the "buyer" is restored—when the patient or employer contracts directly with the provider—prices fall, and value increases. The DPC model proves that primary care does not require insurance; it requires a relationship funded by a subscription.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    For services that cannot be handled within a DPC arrangement—such as surgeries, advanced imaging, and specialist procedures—Reference-Based Pricing (RBP) serves as the market disciplinarian. Under RBP, the plan sponsor sets a maximum reimbursement limit (the "reference price") for a specific service, often pegged to a multiple of Medicare rates (e.g., 140% or 200% of Medicare).<a href="#ref-37" class="citation">[37]</a> If a patient chooses a provider charging above this limit, they are responsible for the difference (balance billing), though in practice, many plans negotiate settlements or steer patients to providers who accept the reference price.

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Montana Miracle and Beyond</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The most prominent validation of RBP comes from the State of Montana Employee Health Plan. Facing insolvency, the plan moved to an RBP model that pegged hospital reimbursements to a percentage of Medicare (averaging roughly 234%). This move saved the state approximately $47.8 million over the first few years.<a href="#ref-39" class="citation">[39]</a> Crucially, it forced price transparency. The state published what it would pay, and hospitals, faced with the loss of the state's large employee block, accepted the rates.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Similar success was seen with CalPERS (California Public Employees' Retirement System). By implementing reference pricing for hip and knee replacements, setting a threshold of $30,000, CalPERS motivated patients to choose lower-priced, high-quality hospitals. This resulted in a 19% shift in market share to value-based facilities and saved the system millions without any measurable decline in outcomes.<a href="#ref-41" class="citation">[41]</a>
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Mechanism of Action</h3>
                <p class="mb-6">
                    RBP transforms the "open-ended" insurance checkbook into a "defined contribution" for specific procedures. It leverages the fact that commercial prices are often 250% to 300% of Medicare rates—a disparity that is difficult to justify by cost differences alone.<a href="#ref-38" class="citation">[38]</a> By anchoring payment to a stable, albeit governmental, benchmark, RBP reintroduces a price ceiling that the opaque commercial market fails to provide. It forces providers to compete against a transparent standard rather than negotiating secret discounts off inflated "chargemaster" rates.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    A purely consumer-driven system faces a critical vulnerability: the "running out of money" problem. High-risk patients or those with low incomes may deplete their HSAs, leading to the abandonment of care. To address this, the proposed framework borrows from supply chain management ("Periodic Automatic Replenishment" or PAR levels) and international safety net models to create a "Dynamic Safety Net."
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">International Lessons: The Singapore Model</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Singapore operates a consumer-anchored system grounded in "MediSave" (mandatory health savings accounts). However, it recognizes that savings are not always sufficient. The "MediFund" acts as a government endowment that serves as a safety net of last resort. When a patient's MediSave and insurance (MediShield) are exhausted, MediFund provides top-ups to ensure that no citizen is denied care due to inability to pay.<a href="#ref-42" class="citation">[42]</a> This "bottom-up" funding mechanism is distinct from the U.S. "top-down" insurance subsidy; it funds the patient at the point of failure, rather than funding the insurer preemptively.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">The "Reverse Deductible" and Automatic Replenishment</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Adapting this to the U.S. context involves a mechanism of "Automatic Replenishment." In this model, if a low-income patient's HSA balance falls below a critical threshold (PAR level) due to medically necessary spending (e.g., insulin, dialysis, verified chronic care), a subsidy trigger is activated to refill the account.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    This creates a "Reverse Deductible." Instead of the patient paying the first $5,000 before insurance kicks in, the system (via subsidy redistribution) ensures the first $2,000 (for example) is always available in the account for routine maintenance care. If the patient manages their health well, the funds accumulate. If they have a high-cost chronic need, the replenishment mechanism ensures liquidity.<a href="#ref-44" class="citation">[44]</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This dynamic approach aligns with supply chain logic used in hospitals to manage inventory.<a href="#ref-45" class="citation">[45]</a> Just as a hospital automatically reorders supplies when stock hits a minimum level to prevent stockouts, the health financing system would "reorder" capital for a patient when their health funds hit a minimum, preventing "care stockouts." This ensures continuity of care for the vulnerable without negating the market discipline for the broader population.

                    The transition to this model has profound macroeconomic implications. The Yale study on hospital pricing provides a critical data point: a 1% increase in healthcare prices lowers payroll and employment at non-health firms by 0.4%.<a href="#ref-11" class="citation">[11]</a> Conversely, restraining price growth through consumer discipline would act as a stimulus for wages and employment.

The Paragon Institute estimates that appropriating CSRs directly and prohibiting "silver loading" could reduce federal deficits by billions while expanding coverage options.<a href="#ref-27" class="citation">[27]</a> Furthermore, eliminating the "administrative wedge" of 2:1 costs in hospitals would liberate capital that could be reinvested in wages for clinical staff or price reductions for patients.

                <p class="mb-6">
                    The path to "Restoring the Buyer" requires a coordinated sequence of policy and market actions. The expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies at the end of 2025 creates a "fiscal cliff" that serves as a forcing function for reform.<a href="#ref-48" class="citation">[48]</a>
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">Strategic Roadmap</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">To move from theory to practice, we propose a phased policy agenda:</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 mb-8">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Enact the "HSA Option":</strong> Congress should transform ACA CSR subsidies into refundable tax credits deposited into HSAs for low-income exchange enrollees. This creates a class of well-funded patients in the individual market who literally hold the money in their hands. (This idea has gained bipartisan attention: recent tax law changes now allow ACA bronze/catastrophic plans to be HSA-eligible but we need to be more aggressive where only high deductible plans are offered to folks availing subsidies and a HSA type account is opened.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mandate Site-Neutral Payment:</strong> CMS should finalize and expand site-neutral rules. All payors (Medicare, Medicaid, ACA plans and major commercial plans) must reimburse outpatient services at the same rate regardless of setting. This aligns with MedPAC and BPC recommendations and would quickly eliminate the hospital "facility fee" arbitrage. Congressional action may be needed to fully level the field for all existing hospital clinics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Promote HSAs and ICHRAs:</strong> Encourage employers to adopt HSA-eligible plans and Individual Coverage HRAs. Tax incentives or matching contributions can accelerate employee HSA funding. This helps shift employer coverage from open-ended insurance to defined contributions plus high-deductible coverage. Employers should also incentivize enrollment in DPC or telemedicine for primary care (for example, by covering monthly membership fees).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Transparency and Reference Pricing:</strong> Federal and state regulators should require public reporting of negotiated prices by procedure and provider (building on CMS transparency rules). States could pilot reference pricing for state employees or Medicaid (e.g. paying only up to a benchmark rate). These steps give patients and purchasers the information needed to steer business to lower-cost providers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Strengthen Safety Nets:</strong> Use Section 1332 waivers or legislation to create "auto-funding" for sicker patients. For example, a Virginia pilot spontaneously enrolled Medicaid-eligible people in an HSA paired with premium assistance; similar dynamic subsidies could be tested. The goal is to ensure that as people spend down their accounts, they get government top-ups or catastrophic coverage seamlessly, preserving both market discipline and universal protection.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Each step is independently valuable but more powerful in combination. By 2027, penalties on excessive spending (like California's affordability caps) will start taking effect; our reforms would help hospitals and insurers meet those caps by cutting waste. Likewise, proposed IRS rules in 2026 make more health plans HSA-compatible, signaling federal momentum for patient-directed accounts. This is a pivotal moment: with careful legislation and regulation, we can leverage existing policy shifts (ACA rule changes, DPC laws, tax code tweaks) to transform incentives.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 font-medium text-lg">
                    The United States does not have a healthcare funding problem; it has a market design problem.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The current architecture, by insulating the buyer from the transaction, has destroyed the feedback loops necessary for price discipline and quality improvement. The evidence from 2024 and 2025 is clear: administrative waste is strangling the system, consolidation is inflating prices without improving quality, and traditional cost-containment methods are failing to bend the curve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Restoring the Buyer" is not an ideological abstraction but a pragmatic economic necessity. By anchoring the system in the consumer—armed with capital (HSAs), information (Transparency), and fair market rules (Site Neutrality)—we can reverse the consolidation trends, strip out administrative waste, and align the financial health of the system with the physical health of the patient. The "Next-Generation" model, with its integrated safety nets and value-based design, offers a credible, evidence-based path out of the current crisis.

                    This paper was authored by an independent observer and private citizen driven by the urgent need for structural healthcare reform. It stems from the recognition that current legislative proposals address only the symptoms of cost inflation—pricing secrecy, billing disparities, and administrative waste—without curing the underlying disease: the separation of the consumer from the financial transaction. This framework is submitted not as an academic exercise, but as a practical blueprint for restoring market discipline to a sector that has lost it.
